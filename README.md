# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **React**, **Framer Motion**, and **Tailwind CSS** to showcase my skills, certificates, and projects. The website is divided into three main sections: **Home**, **Certificates**, and **Projects**.

## Introduction

This portfolio website provides an overview of my professional skills, achievements, and the projects I've worked on. The website is designed to be clean, simple, and user-friendly with smooth animations, thanks to **Framer Motion**, and a modern design style provided by **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features
- **Animated Transitions**: Page transitions are handled using Framer Motion for a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and adapts to devices of all sizes, using Tailwind CSS.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Each section of the portfolio is navigable through specific routes.
- **Certificates Display**: A dedicated page to showcase all the certificates I've earned.
- **Projects Showcase**: A project page highlighting all the projects I've built.
- **Modern Styling**: The website's look and feel are enhanced by the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the UI and managing components.
- **Framer Motion**: For animations and transitions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **React Router**: For handling routing between different pages.
